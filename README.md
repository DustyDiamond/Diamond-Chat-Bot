Diamond Chatbot (DCB) is a simple small Counter Program with Twitch integration.  
You can store as many counters as you whish, accessing three counters at the same time. For every counter you can set your own keybinds, name and display text.  
You also can connect DCB with your twitch account to access it from your live chat. You can define users who are allowed to control and change your counters. All counters are stored in a .xml-file and are written each to a single .txt-file, so you can integrate it to your Stream-Scene.
